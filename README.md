# Home Automation Device Quality Tracker

This repo aims to track home automation devices quality and issue reports across multiple platforms


## How to report a bad device/brand problem

1. Open a issue
2. In the issue clearly state the brand and device you are reporting issues (if you are reporting a brand, please state all the devices you found the issue);
3. Clearly state the devices models and firmware you have tested;
4. State wich software you where using (home assistant, zigbee2mqtt, Deconz, ...);
5. Add any extra information you think will be usefull;
6. Not be mad if the device/brand doesn't automaticly enter the "not so good" list. Just because you found issues, doesn't mean is terrible, maybe is just unreliable with the combination of software/coordinator stick you are using ðŸ˜ž
